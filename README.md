## About Me

Ex-Army veteran turned DevOps enthusiast, I'm driven by a passion for automation and cloud solutions to secure a better future for my family. After completing an 11-week DevOps fellowship at Booz Allen Hamilton (Nov 2024), I've been actively seeking remote DevOps roles since December 2024. My journey is fueled by grit, problem-solving, and a commitment to continuous learning.

### Overview

My flagship project, the [AWS DevOps Demo](https://github.com/paulcyi/aws-devops-demo), is a scalable web application hosted on AWS ECS with Fargate, featuring a live DynamoDB hit counter. It showcases:

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds and deployments with GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Dockerized Python Flask app
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and auto scaling with SNS alerts

### Challenges Overcome

- Resolved backend state drift and IAM permission issues
- Debugged container dependency errors and optimized resource tagging
- Implemented health check logging and scaling policies
