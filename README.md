## About Me
Ex-Army veteran turned DevOps enthusiast, I’m driven by a passion for automation and cloud solutions. After completing an 11-week DevOps fellowship at Booz Allen Hamilton (Nov 2024), I’ve been honing my skills through hands-on projects. My journey is fueled by grit, problem-solving, and a commitment to growth.

## Skills
- **Languages/Frameworks**: Python (Flask)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (ECS, Fargate, ALB, DynamoDB, IAM, S3, CloudWatch, ECR)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Soft Skills**: Troubleshooting, team collaboration, resilience under pressure

## Featured Project: AWS DevOps Demo
### Overview
My flagship project, the [AWS DevOps Demo](https://github.com/paulcyi/aws-devops-demo), is a scalable web application hosted on AWS ECS with Fargate, featuring a live DynamoDB hit counter. It showcases:
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds and deployments with GitHub Actions.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized Python Flask app.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure.
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and auto scaling with SNS alerts.
